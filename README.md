# T.Cao-Horiseon-Refactoring

## Description 
This is my first assigned Challenge in bootcamp. 
Objective: refactor an existing code.  

**What I've learned from this project**:
- Refactoring makes code more concise and more legible
- **Div soup** :) Google taught me what div is and alternative elements to use in place of div
- Live Server is my best friend when working with code
- I can break everything with a single semicolon (or lack thereof)
- There are tons of elements & they're all super useful (ex: body, header, nav, button, section, etc)
- Class and ID are fairly interchangeable, but you can only assign an ID to one element
- ID's can be used to redirect links to corresponding places on a webpage!
